^^^^^

**ORTHO**\ logous group of genes **S**\ plitti\ **N**\ g **A**\ nd **P**\ runing
(**orthosnap**) was developed as part of `Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_'s
graduate thesis work. 

Increasing the number of genes used during phylogenomic analysis is a promising 
startegy to resolve contentious branches. To facilitate creating larger phylogenomic
data matrices, we developed orthosnap, an algorithm that identifies subgroups of
single-copy orthologous genes.
